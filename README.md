# few_good_truths

It's a common annoyance: you're in a meeting, someone says "You want
that feature?!", and some smart-aleck has to follow it with "You can't
HANDLE that feature!".  Now you can be that smart-aleck, but dorkier,
and with more parts of speech than you ever imagined.

This was a bit of fun to start with, though it's really cumbersome to
use.  But for those office polemics where you for some reason must be
the type of person to like this, it's useful.

Just some silly jokes.


# Examples

Example:

~~~
$ python2 few_good_truths.py

C++: You want high performance applications?
Python: I think I'm entitled to them.
C++: You want high performance applications?
Python: I want the best programming language!
C++: You can't handle the best programming language! Son, we live in a world that has memory locations. And those memory locations have to be addressed via pointers. Who's gonna do it? You? You, C#? I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom. You weep for automatic memory management and you curse the trait system. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know: that automatic memory management's elision, while tragic, probably increased performance. And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, increases performance...You don't want the best programming language. Because deep down, in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me pointing to that memory location. You need me pointing to that memory location.
We use words like reference, smart pointer, trampoline...we use these words as the backbone to a life spent improving performance. You use 'em as punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very performance I provide, then questions the manner in which I provide it! I'd rather you just said thank you and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you read the dragon book and write a compiler. Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you're entitled to!
Python: Did you sacrifice productivity for determinism?
C++: (quietly) I did the job you sent me to do.
Python: Did you sacrifice productivity for determinism?
C++: You're goddamn right I did!!
