Just some silly jokes to weakly amuse.  Please don't look at the code.

Usage examples:

    $ ./few_good_truths.py cliche

    Jessup: You want answers?
    Kaffee: I think I'm entitled to them.
    Jessup: You want answers?
    Kaffee: I want the truth!
    Jessup: You can't handle the truth! Son, we live in a world that has walls. And those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. Who's gonna do it? You? You, Lt. Weinberg? I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom. You weep for Santiago and you curse the Marines. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know: that Santiago's death, while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives...You don't want the truth. Because deep down, in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me on that wall. You need me on that wall.
    We use words like honor, code, loyalty...we use these words as the backbone to a life spent defending something. You use 'em as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom I provide, then questions the manner in which I provide it! I'd rather you just said thank you and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post. Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you're entitled to!
    Kaffee: Did you order the code red?
    Jessup: (quietly) I did the job you sent me to do.
    Kaffee: Did you order the code red?
    Jessup: You're goddamn right I did!!


    $ ./few_good_truths.py rmsvssteve

    Steve: You want answers?
    Richard: I think I'm entitled to them.
    Steve: You want answers?
    Richard: I want the freedom!
    Steve: You can't handle the freedom! Son, we live in a world that has users. And those users have to be coddled with shiny UIs and fart apps. Who's gonna do it? You? You, Linus? I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom. You weep for BSD-licensed code and you curse the proprietary hardware vendors. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know: that BSD-licensed code's proliferation, while tragic, probably harmed Windows adoption. And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, increases POSIX installs...You don't want the freedom. Because deep down, in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me coddling that user. You need me coddling that user.
    We use words like design, beauty, gradient fill...we use these words as the backbone to a life spent selling to users who don't understand mice with more than one button. You use 'em as anti-vi joke. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very userbase I provide, then questions the manner in which I provide it! I'd rather you just said thank you and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you take a shower and man a Genius bar for an hour. Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you're entitled to!
    Richard: Did you sacrifice Woz and copy PARC's ideas?
    Steve: (quietly) I did the job you sent me to do.
    Richard: Did you sacrifice Woz and copy PARC's ideas?
    Steve: You're goddamn right I did!!
